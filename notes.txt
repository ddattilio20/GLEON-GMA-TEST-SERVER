Home Page
- Graphs, most difficult — hold off for a bit

About
- just a simple about page with a redirect to GLEON site

Data 
- where people can download data—hold off until database is done

Contact
- simple contact page

Login
- where users will login and upload, waiting on DB

Upload 
- separate page, only accessible by people logged in —waiting on DB
- look up how to only redirect people logged in?? Right now it's just a path, has to be a better way for users -- DB






Notes:
All pages are named PageDetail; this is to make them group together in PyCharm easier to make it less cluttered


Example of Redirect Button:
dbc.Button("Learn More About the Project", href="/PageAbout", color="secondary"),
