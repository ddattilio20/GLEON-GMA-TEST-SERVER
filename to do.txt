To do:

2. 









Notes:

-Heroku falls asleep after 30 mins of inactivity
-free tier heroku has 2 types, unverified and verified
    -verified means you have card details verified (gets you 1000 hours of activity per month)
    -unverified 550 hours of dyno per month

Uptime Robot potential fix to app falling asleep



-Free heroku falls asleep
    potential fixes:
        - paid heroku 
        - aws (paid)
        - host at ku 
        - host on a local machine (probably not viable)
        - bot to 'tickle' heroku site to prevent it from falling asleep

- Slow load times for site modules
    potential fixes:
        - move import statements around to lessen first load times
        -


-data not writing to aws bucket
    potential fixes:
        - switch to sql database (not ideal)
        - change data upload code
        -heroku postgresql (free option, probably viable)
        -aws database (sql or postgresql)
